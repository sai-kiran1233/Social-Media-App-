These are my frontend codes of the Homepage , connect to the backend of my code as per the code previously shared. 

Before sharing the frontend code I would like to share a brief description of the Home page :

3. Home Page - This page will be the main landing page of our app - the page is divided into two columns sidebar and tweet list a. Sidebar - Sidebar will contain all the navigation links, app logo and logged in user name and email - Clicking on the nav links will get to appropriate page - We also have a logout button and clicking this will logout the user and redirect to the login page again. 

b. Tweet list This section will contain list of tweets where each tweet card will contain the following details: - User photo, user name, tweet time, delete button (only user who created the tweet can only delete), tweet content, like button, retweet button and reply button - On clicking the like button a tweet will be liked and the icon will turn into a red color. - On clicking on the reply button a dialog will open where user can enter tweet details and submit - We will also have a tweet button when clicking on it will open a dialog asking for tweet content and will create a new tweet when submit

Note: the tweets list section is scrollable and sidebar will remain as sticky

Delete button (only visible on tweets which logged in user tweeted)

Clicking on the tweet button will open tweet Modal dialog

Show toast after every successful operation using react-hot-toast

Retweet indicator Add a text indicator like below if a tweet is retweeted by someone (with username)

Username in the tweet card username in the tweet card is clickable which will go to that user profile page

Reply on Tweet
Clicking on reply button will open a dialog where you can enter tweet details and reply your tweet

Now I will share the codes after giving you the code I will say " Code uploaded" after that you make the connection between the backend and frontend also, you add comments for any UI component is missing.
